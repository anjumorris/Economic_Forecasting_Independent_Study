# ECON 5305 - Forecasting for Business and Economics
# Independent Study for ECON 5305
## Taught by Dr. Xie Sihong

This is additional course material for the course ECON 5305 that I worked on through my independent study with Professor Xie Sihong.
During the class for each week, all the students participated in a discussion where we tried to solve selected problems in the textbook: Forecasting for Economics and Business by Gloria Gonz√°lez-Rivera

During my independent study, I did the following

- collected relevant data for solving the discussion problems in the textbook for all the students to use
- documented the data collection through videos.
- solved and discussed the problem assigned to me. All 13 students in the class participated contributing their ideas.
- solved and summarized all the discussions for the selected problems using R notebooks

I felt that the materials would be useful for future students to go through as a reference. **_PLEASE DO NOT PLAGARIZE_** the code. The summaries/solutions provided here are not the only way to think about problems but just one of many possibilities. Discussion and understanding of different perspectives are more valuable than the code presented here.
